The Vehicle Parking Management System project employs digital logic components and Arduino technology to address parking challenges. The system uses sensors to detect vehicle presence, control entry and exit barriers, and dynamically allocate parking slots. Components used include D flip flops, OR gates, AND gates, Up-Down Decade Counter, Hex Displays, 4:16 Demux, and LEDs. 

The circuit was first simulated in Logisim and then implemented on a trainer kit. Arduino Uno was programmed to interface with ultrasonic sensors, detecting vehicle presence and generating clock pulse signals. These signals update the vehicle count, control barriers, and manage parking slot availability in real time. This integration enhances resource allocation and user experience, promoting urban mobility and sustainability.
